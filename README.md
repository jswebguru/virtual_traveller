## How to run

## Idea
I wanted to make a flight searching app with interesting suggestions, fully from the scratch. However, due to the current situation with the pandemic, many countries are restricted for some citizens so travelling there isn't possible. This app has virtual travelling mode, which simulates the travelling here, displays interesting information about the desired location, including picture, points of interests and etc. There's a possibility to save the locations, so you can check them out later!

## Visualizing the flow of the app

## App Architecture
Using the bloc library allows us to separate our application into three layers:

- Presentation
- Business Logic
- Data
  - Repository
  - Data Provider
  - Models

## State management 
There's no unique rule on what to choose because it always depends on many criteria. When it came to deciding on which state management approach to use in my case, I was deciding between Provider and bloc library. Bloc library is already dependant on Provider package so it is fairly similar in terms of a dependency injection (DI) (a single instance of a Cubit or Bloc can be provided to all of the widgets within a subtree). [Read more here about bloc library](https://bloclibrary.dev/#/) and [Provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider).

The reasons why I decided to use the bloc library in my case were following:
- use of the reactive streams, which goes well together with BLoC pattern
- easy and reliable tests via bloc_test library, which is based on Mockito
- it isn't only a state management library, but it also helps implement the BLoC (Business Logic Component) design pattern
